# Linked Lists 

Linked lists are a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node is composed of data and a reference/link to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the sequence points to null.

Usually, the first node in the sequence is called the head and the last node is called the tail.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have indexes. To access a node in a linked list, you have to start at the the head and iterate through the nodes until you reach the desired node.

In memory, they are not stored in a contiguous block of memory, but rather scattered throughout memory. This is because each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence. So unlike arrays, you can not instantly access a node in a linked list.

# Detect Cycle 

```js
//Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
//Time complexity: O(n)
// Its designed to detect a cycle in a linked list
//It uses two pointers, one slow and one fast
//Fast one moves two nodes at a time, slow one moves one node at a time
//Analogy: two runners running on a track, one faster  than the other
export function hasCycle(list) {
    let slow = list.head
    let fast = list.head

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if (slow.value ==== fast.value) {
            return value
        }
    }

    return false
}
```

This algorithm is pretty interesting. It's designed to detect a cycle in a linked list. It uses two pointers, one slow and one fast. The fast one moves two nodes at a time, while the slow one moves one node at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast one will eventually catch up to the slow one. If there is no cycle, the fast one will reach the end of the list.

It's cool because when i initially tried solving this, I overcomplicated it, but this is so simple and beautiful.

# Reverse Linked List

```js
export function reverseLinkedList(list) {
    let prevNode = null
    let currentNode = list.head

    while (currentNode) {
        const nextNode = currentNode.next
        currentNode.next = prevNode

        prevNode = currentNode
        currentNode = nextNode
    }

    list.head = prevNode
}
```

I got this pretty quickly except i started with `let prevNode = list.head` and `let currentNode = list.head.next`. This is wrong because you want to start off with `prevNode` as `null` and `currentNode` as `list.head`. Otherwise, you will end up with a cycle. You end with a cycle because you are setting `currentNode.next` to `prevNode`, but `prevNode` is not `null`, it's `list.head`, so you end up with a cycle.

To visiualise how messed up this gets:

```js
export function reversedLinkedList(list) {
    //Incorrect initialisation
    let prevNode = list.head //Lets say list.head is Node A
    let currentNode = list.head.next //Lets say list.head.next is Node B

    while (currentNode) {
        const nextNode = currentNode.next //Assume currentNode is Node B initially
        currentNode.next = prevNode // Set Node B's next to Node A (cycle formed here)

        //Move forward in the list
        prevNode = currentNode //prevNode becomes node b
        currentNoe = nextNode // currentNode moves to the next node in the original list
    }

    // After first iteration
    //Node A and Node B point to each other, forming a cycle.
    list.head = prevNode
}
```

# Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

Merging two sorted linked lists is done by creating a new list. This is key. If you have a new list, you simply iterate through the the two lists  and add the smaller node to the new list. You kepp doing this until you reach the end of one of the lists. Then you add the rest of the other list to the new list. Which is fine because we are assuming that the lists are sorted.

```js
export function mergeSortedLists (list1, list2) {
    let mergedList = new SinglyLinkedList()

    let firstHead = list1.head
    let secondHead = list2.head

    if (!firstHead) return list2
    if (!secondHead) return list1

    //One of the lists will reach the end first
    while (firstHead !== null && secondHead !== null) {
        //Simply add the smaller node to the new list
        //Then move forward to the next iteration
        if (firstHead.value < secondHead.value) {
            mergedList.append(firstHead.value)
            firstHead = firstHead.next
        } else {
            mergedList.append(firstHead.value)
            secondhead = secondHead.next
        }
    }

    // Either this list or the other list has reached the end
    // Both are not null!
    while (firstHead !== null) {
        mergedList.append(firstHead.value)
        firstHead = firstHead.next
    }

    //If this happens, it means the first list has reached the end
    while (secondHead !== null) {
        mergedList.append(firstHead.value)
        secondHead = secondHead.next
    }

    return mergedList
}
```

This form of looping is interesting where you check if a value in `while` loop is not `null` and you proceed iterating till it is. 

What's interesting, you see a similar `while` loop done for breadth-first search where you continue till queue is not empty, but keep popping off and filling in the queue is not empty, but keep popping off and filling in the queue with the unvisited neighbors.`
